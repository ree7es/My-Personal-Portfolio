# My-Personal-Portfolio
ID Assignment 1 - Personal Portfolio

For my ID Assignment 1 Project, I decided to create a personal portfolio website as I believe that this would be beneficial for me in the future when I'm making websites from scratch. My website contains 5 main sections. Home, About Me, Education and Achievements, Photos that describe me and a Contact Me page which allows contractors to hire me. The website allows people hiring to have a detailed insight into my education as well as a glimpse of my personal life, like the things I enjoy doing in my spare time to show that I have a balanced work-play lifestyle.
